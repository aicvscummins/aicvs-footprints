# AICVS - FOOTPRINTS

AICVS - FOOTPRINTS is a blog series which will be featuring blogs of students for sharing their views and journey on any research, project or internship in AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) and data science. We also appreciate people interested in sharing their views on any other technical field as well. These blogs will be featured on every alternate Sunday on our website.
